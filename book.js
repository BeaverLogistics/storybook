    { images: ['0.png'], textPosition: 'top', text: `Hi, my name is Thang and I am a Solution Design Engineer at CEVA Logistics. I wanted to challenge myself to create something a bit different and using technologies I haven't used before. This was made in less than 48 hours without any prior knowledge in web development. <br></br>I love learning but most of all, I love working with others to achieve a common goal. It is very exciting to be able to meet others at Tangram and build invaluable relationships. If possible, it would be greatly beneficial to work on a space utilisation optimiser. This will reduce waste dramatically and is replicable across the business lines. <br></br>This quick story is just a quick explanation to a child why space utilisation is very important. Please enjoy!` },
